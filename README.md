# 🛳️ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is my solution for the classic [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare.
